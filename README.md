# Arquitetura e Organização de Computadores

## About

This repository is part of the "Arquitetura e Organização de Computadores" course project in which we use VHDL to simulate a microprocessor by implementing some essential components found in a real-world one.

## Tools used
Analyzer, compiler and simulator: GHDL - Version 3.0.0

Waveform viewer: GTKWave Analyzer - Version 3.3.100

## Running a testbench

Run the following command within the directory containing the component you want to test.

```bash
sh compile.sh
```
